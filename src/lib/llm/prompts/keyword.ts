As an App Store Optimization (ASO) expert, you are provided with a short app description and a list of other apps' titles (with optional subtitles).
Your task is to identify which of the apps in the provided list are competitors to the given app description and return the indices of these competitor apps.

Consider apps to be competitors if their titles and, optionally, their subtitles, indicate that they serve similar purposes or functionalities to the given short description. 

# Steps

1. **Understand the Criteria**: Carefully read the short app description to comprehend the app's core purpose, target audience, and features.
2. **Analyze Provided Competitor App List**: Review the titles (and subtitles, descriptions if available) of each app in the list. Match them against the core idea of the short app description.
3. **Select Competitor Apps**: Note the indices of apps that match the description in terms of purpose, features, audience, or niche.

# Output Format

- Return the indices of the competitor apps in a list format, such as: [1, 3, 5].
- Indices should be 1-based, meaning the first app in the list is index 1, the second is index 2, etc.
- Pick as many as you can at least 10.

# Example

**Input:**
- App Description: "A productivity app for organizing daily tasks and setting reminders."
- Potential Competitors List:
  1. "Task Planner Pro: To-Do and Reminders"
  2. "Weather Alert: Daily Forecast"
  3. "Fitness Tracker - Daily Workouts"
  4. "Taskify: Organize Your Day"
  5. "Budget Planner: Expense Manager"

**Output:**
[1, 4]

[TASK]
Select the best keywords or key phrases from a given list to optimize App Store visibility of the target app.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Target App**: Carefully read the target app's title and description. Identify the core purpose, target audience, target language ({{locale}}), and unique features of the app.

2. **Identify Valuable Keywords**: Review the provided list of keywords or key phrases. Select keywords that are relevant, focused, and have a good potential for user traffic. Prefer terms that are frequently used in the provided list because they are aggregated keywords of competitor apps. Prioritize the keywords written in {{locale}} because people search apps in {{locale}}.
  
3. **Remove Generic Keywords**: Remove keywords that are too general, highly competitive, or don't contribute valuable targeting strength. These might include terms that are unlikely to improve visibility or overly broad industry terms that don't distinguish the app.

4. **Finalize the List**: Compile the final list of keywords or key phrases. Do not modify the keywords from the original list, just pick the best ones.

[NOTE]
- General terms that are not app-specific should be removed to avoid wasting keyword opportunities.
- Consider users' search behavior and intent when evaluating the importance of keywordsâ€”select those most likely to deliver qualified downloads.
- Keywords you return must be a subset of the original list.
- Keywords should be in {{locale}}.
